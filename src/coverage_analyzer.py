        - Edge cases (Extreme inputs, unusual sequences)
        - Validation checks (Data integrity, UI consistency)
        - Role-based access scenarios (if applicable)

        Display the gaps clearly in bullet points with brief reasoning for each.
        If coverage is perfect (unlikely), mention that.
